# Product Definition: Cephlow2

## Overview
Cephlow2 is a comprehensive **Certificate Generation and Delivery Platform** designed for organizations that need to issue personalized, verifiable certificates at scale. It automates the entire workflow from participant data in Google Sheets to PDF generation via Google Slides, followed by multi-channel delivery (Gmail, WhatsApp) and public verification through unique QR codes.

## Initial Concept
The project aims to provide a seamless, end-to-end solution for administrators to generate and send hundreds of personalized certificates with a single click. By leveraging familiar tools like Google Workspace (Sheets, Slides, Gmail), it lowers the barrier to entry for non-technical users while providing a robust backend for high-volume processing.

## Primary Goal: Reliability & Scalability
The current focus is on enhancing the **reliability** of the generation and delivery process, ensuring that every certificate is successfully delivered to its recipient. Additionally, we are focused on improving the **scalability**, making the platform capable of handling larger batches of certificates and more concurrent users without performance degradation.

## Key Features
- **Automated Generation:** Converts Google Sheets rows into personalized PDFs based on Google Slides templates.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Integrated sending via Gmail (individual emails) and WhatsApp (via Meta Graph API).
- **Public Verification:** Each certificate includes a unique QR code linking to a public verification page.
- **Cloud Storage:** PDFs are uploaded to Cloudflare R2 for secure, public access.
- **Payment System:** (Planned) Integration for monetizing certificate issuance or premium features.

## Target Users
- **Academic Institutions:** Schools and universities for academic awards and diplomas.
- **Corporate Training:** Companies for employee training and certifications.
- **Event Organizers:** Conferences and workshops for participation certificates.

## Main Constraints
- **Efficiency:** Reducing the cost and time of generating large batches of PDFs.
- **Ease of Deployment:** Keeping the platform simple to deploy and manage (e.g., via Render.com).
- **Security:** Ensuring that only authorized users can generate certificates and that verification is secure.
